These scripts will plot the boundaries of a ROI on a surface. Additionally code is provided so that certain regions can be excluded from the colourmap.

There are four ways of defining a boundary here, 'faces', 'midpoint', 'centroid', and 'edges'.

'faces' will find the faces which exist between ROIs and those will be coloured black to specify the boundary. 

'midpoint' finds the edges that connect the vertices of two different ROIs and takes the midpoint of the egde and uses those coordinates to define the boundary. 

'centroid' finds the faces which exist between ROIs and uses the centroid of those to draw the coordinates that define the boundary. 

'edges' finds the edges, and associated vertices, which define the boundary of the ROI and draws the boundary along those. 

demo_plotSurfaceROIBoundary.m shows examples of how the code is used. See plotSurfaceROIBoundary.m, makeFaceVertexCData.m, and findROIboundaries.m for a more detailed description. I personally recommend using 'midpoint', visually it looks the cleanest and you can easily change the thickness/width of the boundary. 'faces' will look clean but you cannont change the thickness/width, 'centroid' doesn't look especially neat but you can change the thickness, while with 'edges' the boundaries of adjacent ROIs will leave a slight gap between them (i.e. they don't overlap) which can look a bit strange.

See makeFaceVertexCData.m for how to configure a colormap to exclude certain regions (e.g., regions which have no ROI information)

example_surface_data.mat includes vertices and faces for fsaverage, along with parcellations for the Desikan-Killiany atlas, HCPMMP1 parcellation, and a random 200 (100 ROIs per hemisphere) parcellation.

# Plotting boundaries

The first four figures show the different types of boundary method projected over the surface where each face is coloured according to the vertex ROI IDs. While a face can be connected to multiple ROIs, each face is colored by the value of the first vertex that constitutes that face (in other words, when plotting each face appears to only be assigned to one ROI when it infact belongs to multiple). This is why for 'midpoint', 'centroid', and 'edges' the boundary drawn doesn't exactly follow the face colours. Anatomically based parcellations (like the Desikan-Killiany and HCPMMP1 parcellations) tend to produce jagged boundaries in my experience. All these figures can be replicated using demo_plotSurfaceROIBoundary.m

The next four figures show the different types of boundary method projected over the surface where each face is coloured according to an interpolated value of the vertex values (which in this case is the sulcal depth of each vertex).
